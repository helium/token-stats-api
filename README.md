# Helium Token API

This API is primarily responsible for serving token statistics for external parties like [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/helium) and [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/helium/). It is maintained by Helium Core Developers.

It's currently served at https://explorer.helium.com which was responsible for serving this API and other dashboards for the Helium network. Dashboards have now been moved to https://world.helium.com/.
